# Gradle for Android and Java Final Project

In this project, you will create an app with multiple flavors that uses
multiple libraries and Google Cloud Endpoints. The finished app will consist
of four modules. A Java library that provides jokes, a Google Cloud Endpoints
(GCE) project that serves those jokes, an Android Library containing an
activity for displaying jokes, and an Android app that fetches jokes from the
GCE module and passes them to the Android Library for display.

### Step 0: Starting Point
### Step 1: Create a Java library
### Step 2: Create an Android Library
### Step 3: Setup GCE
### Step 4: Add Functional Tests
### Step 5: Add a Paid Flavor
## Optional Tasks

For extra practice to make your project stand out, complete the following tasks.

### Add Interstitial Ad

Follow these instructions to add an interstitial ad to the free version.
Display the ad after the user hits the button, but before the joke is shown.

### Add Loading Indicator

Add a loading indicator that is shown while the joke is being retrieved and
disappears when the joke is ready. The following tutorial is a good place to
start:

### Configure Test Task

To tie it all together, create a Gradle task that:

1. Launches the GCE local development server
2. Runs all tests
3. Shuts the server down again
